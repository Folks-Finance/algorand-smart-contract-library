    """Contract module that allows children to implement scheduled upgrade mechanisms.

    A contract upgrade must be scheduled at least "min upgrade delay" time in the future. Changes to the "min upgrade
    delay" must similarly wait.

    If there is a change scheduled and a new scheduled change is submitted, the old change will be overwritten by the
    new change.

    The maximum size of programs on Algorand is 8192 bytes (approval + clear). However, the maximum byte width of the
    Algorand Virtual Machine is 4096 bytes. Therefore to get around these limits, we use a hash of the contract to
    upgrade to:
        program_sha256 = sha256(
            “approval”,
            sha256(approval_program_page_0),
            sha256(approval_program_page_1),
            …
            “clear”
            sha256(clear_program_page_0),
            sha256(clear_program_page_1),
            …
        )

    It is the responsibility of the child contract to grant the `{upgradable_admin_role}`. The `initialise()` ABI
    method, which is left abstract, is the recommended place to do this. If the `{upgradable_admin_role}` is ungranted
    then no account will be able to upgrade the contract using the scheduled upgrade mechanism.

    In addition, when upgrading an application in Algorand, you cannot modify the allocated global/local storage and
    program size. Therefore, it's recommended to pre-allocate all the necessary future storage and program size you may
    need on the initial deployment of your application.
